# AI schema

Events, hooks, and permissions that govern this project. Rules → [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

---

## Events

`*CLAUDE Hardcoded:*` = built-in, unchangeable. `*vz:*` = this project's hook.

## **SessionStart**

chat opens/resumes; stdout injected.

### *CLAUDE Hardcoded:*
- read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
- read [MEMORY.md](../../../.claude/projects/c--Users-adoma-Desktop-coding-vz/memory/MEMORY.md)
- read `.claude/settings`\*
- read env block
- read git status
- read skills / agents / MCP

* *vz:* none.

## **UserPromptSubmit** — your msg, before AI reads it; exit `2` blocks.

### *CLAUDE Hardcoded:*
- `<system-reminder>` notes + recalled memory.

* *vz:* `rule_schema_reminder.py` → rule-add/change prompt → injects hook-vs-context framework.

## **PreToolUse** — before a tool runs; can block/deny.

### *CLAUDE Hardcoded:*
- permission prompt + IDE diff on Edit/Write.

* *vz:* `permissions.allow` checked here.

## **PostToolUse** — after a tool finishes.

### *CLAUDE Hardcoded:*
- "file changed since read" + linter notes; todo nudge.

* *vz:* `version_reminder.py` → edit `template.html` → badge/SP/rebuild reminder.

## **Notification** — needs input/permission, or idle.

### *CLAUDE Hardcoded:*
- permission popup / idle ping.

* *vz:* none.

## **Stop** — main agent finishes; exit `2` forces continue.

### *CLAUDE Hardcoded:*
- none.

* *vz:* none (prime spot for a hook).

## **SubagentStop** — subagent (Task) finishes; exit `2` forces continue.

### *CLAUDE Hardcoded:*
- none.

* *vz:* none.

## **PreCompact** — before context is compacted.

### *CLAUDE Hardcoded:*
- none.

* *vz:* none.

## **SessionEnd** — session ends (quit, `/clear`).

### *CLAUDE Hardcoded:*
- none.

* *vz:* none.

## Settings files

| File | Scope | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`.claude/settings.local.json`](.claude/settings.local.json) | vz only, gitignored | permissions + two non-blocking hooks |
| [`~/.claude/settings.json`](../../../.claude/settings.json) | every project | no hooks (git-init one removed) |

**Permissions** (`permissions.allow` — auto-approved, no prompt):
- `WebSearch` — web search
- `Bash(git commit *)` — any commit
- `Bash(git pull *)` — any pull
- `Read(//c/Users/adoma/.claude/**)` — read global .claude

**Hooks** (both non-blocking, in vz):
- **PostToolUse** (`Edit|Write`) → `version_reminder.py` — template edit injects badge/SP/rebuild reminder.
- **UserPromptSubmit** → `rule_schema_reminder.py` — rule prompt injects this file's framework.

---

## Claude inner — hardcoded, not hooks

Can't change these — only attach hooks alongside.
- **Memory** — loads CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md (hook runs code; memory loads text).
- **System reminders** — `<system-reminder>` notes + todo nudge, auto-injected.
- **Permissions** — the `permissions.allow` list, checked before each tool.

---

# hooks vs context

Two mechanisms change behaviour; every other label is just text.

## The two mechanisms

- **Hook** — code that runs on an event (SessionStart · UserPromptSubmit · PreToolUse · PostToolUse · Stop).
  - We use it as **aggressive, conditional context** — detects a condition, injects the right reminder.
  - Trigger is deterministic; the AI's response stays its own. Lives in `.claude/settings.json`.
  - Can hard-block, but we don't — it informs, never force-blocks or auto-fixes.
- **Context** — text injected into the window (this file, CLAUDE.md, tool output).
  - Read, not run → influences only, probabilistically. Can be forgotten.
  - Effect decays with length and mid-document position. Naming it "rule" changes nothing.

Real split isn't hard-vs-soft — both inform. It's **always-on vs. fired-on-condition**:
- Plain Context is always in the window, and decays.
- A hook fires only on its trigger — lands sharp, costs nothing when irrelevant.

## `@import` — a Context delivery method, not a third mechanism

- `@path/to/file.md` in CLAUDE.md pulls that whole file's text in every session.
- Resolved at load time: always-on, unconditional, full-file.
- Costs its length every turn whether relevant or not, and can still be forgotten.

## Three ways to put text in front of the model

Pick per rule, by when and whether it loads:
- **Plain Context** — lives in CLAUDE.md, always loaded. For short, always-relevant rules.
- **`@import`** — `@other.md` in CLAUDE.md, always loaded, whole file. For a whole reference doc.
- **Hook-injected Context** — a hook prints `additionalContext`, loaded only when its condition fires.
  - Zero cost when irrelevant; lands at the right moment; only as reliable as its trigger.
  - Our default for any rule a program can detect.

Quick pick:
- short + always-relevant → plain Context
- big doc + always-relevant → `@import`
- only-sometimes-relevant + program-detectable → hook-injected Context

## The hook test

Can a program detect when it's relevant — binary, no judgment?
- **Yes → hook-injected reminder.** Fires when it applies; detection is the verifiable part.
- **No → plain Context.** Always-on, advisory, read with judgment (an LLM-judge is \~65% biased).

Corollary: nothing here force-blocks. A bad trigger gets sharper, not a harder gate.

## Behaviours a program can detect (→ hook injects context, not a block)

Each line is a *trigger → what the hook reminds*, on the named event.
- (PostToolUse) output drifted from source build → remind to rebuild before sending.
- (PostToolUse) generated file hand-edited, not its template → remind to edit source.
- (PostToolUse) version badge ≠ latest history entry → remind to reconcile.
- (PostToolUse) template changed, badge not bumped → remind to bump.
- (PostToolUse) new history entry missing its SP value → remind to add.
- (PostToolUse) embedded JS may be invalid → remind to run syntax check.
- (Stop) tree not clean or `main` not pushed → remind to save.
- (SessionStart) before work → remind (or run) fetch + rebase first.

## Behaviours that can only be Context (judgment → advisory, never a hook)

- is the SP estimate fair? (effort vs value)
- is the design compact / on-brand? (taste)
- fixed the whole bug *class*, not just the shown case?
- terminology right? (turnover vs revenue)
- merge conflicts resolved feature-by-feature, never one side wholesale?

## Adding a behaviour

- One line → apply the hook test → **Hook** (build it) or **Context** (advisory).
- A behaviour isn't enforced until its hook exists. The name never enforces anything.

## Events & hooks
Three hooks touch vz; the rest of each event is CLAUDE-hardcoded. Full map → [Schema.md](Schema.md).
| Event | When | Hook | Does | Blocks? |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **SessionStart** | chat opens/resumes | — (CLAUDE-hardcoded) | loads CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md, settings, env, git status, skills/agents/MCP | no |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | before AI reads prompt | [`rule_schema_reminder.py`](.claude/hooks/rule_schema_reminder.py) | rule-add/change prompt → injects Schema.md's hook-vs-context framework so the AI decides *how* to add it | no |
| **PostToolUse** | after Edit/Write | [`version_reminder.py`](.claude/hooks/version_reminder.py) | edit `template.html` → reminds to bump badge + log SP + rebuild | no |
| **Stop** | AI finishes responding | — (candidate spot) | none yet — could enforce REPO-01 (clean tree + `main` pushed) | n/a |
