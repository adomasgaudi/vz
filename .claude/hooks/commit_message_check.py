"""PreToolUse hook: before a `git commit`, check the message's SUBJECT line
against the vz house format and warn (non-blocking) if it's off.

House format (derived from git log): `vN CODE-NN | description | n sp`
  e.g.  v40 DATA-46 | Data Explorer tab descriptions | 2 sp
        v39 BULD-14 | Fix MY_BRAND crash, unify version counter | 3 sp

WHY a hook here, and why this event:
- The defect is verifiable (a regex decides it, no judgment) -> it passes
  Schema.md's hook test, so a hook is the right mechanism, not prose.
- PreToolUse fires *before* the commit runs, so the warning lands while the AI
  can still re-issue a corrected `git commit`. PostToolUse would warn only after
  the bad message is already in history.
- Non-blocking by design (no exit 2), but the injected message is deliberately
  LOUD ("⛔ STOP … do not proceed") because CLI sessions kept ignoring the old
  soft wording and committing off-format. Wired into the committed
  .claude/settings.json (PreToolUse · Bash) with the `py` launcher so it actually
  runs on the owner's Windows box — the earlier `python3` invocation silently
  failed there, which is why the rule "kept being forgotten".

Mechanistically, step by step:

1. Claude Code runs this before a Bash tool call and pipes the hook JSON to
   stdin. We read `tool_input.command` (the shell string about to run). Any
   parse error -> sys.exit(0) (exit 0, no output = hook does nothing).
2. If the command isn't a `git commit`, exit silently. We only act on commits.
3. Extract the commit MESSAGE from the command. We handle the common forms:
   `-m "..."`, `-m '...'`, and `-m @'...'@` / `@"..."@` PowerShell here-strings
   (whose `@`/`@'`/`'@` delimiters are NOT part of the message and are stripped).
   `--amend` with no `-m` (editor/reuse) -> nothing to check, exit silently.
4. Take the SUBJECT (first non-empty line) and run deterministic checks:
   - stray here-string markers leaked into the text (a leading/standalone `@`),
   - unfilled placeholders (XX, TODO, CODE-XX, `SP:n`, `<...>`),
   - house-format shape: `vNN CODE-NN | ... | n sp`.
5. If anything is off, print hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext describing the
   problems + the expected format. That string is injected into context; the AI
   may fix the message and re-commit. Nothing is blocked.

It cannot block or force anything: no exit 2, no decision:block. It only injects
context. (See Schema.md: hooks here are aggressive *context*, not gates.)
