# vz — project context

**This whole file is *context*** — text injected into the model's window. It *influences* behaviour; it does not *enforce* anything. The only thing that enforces is a **hook** (code that runs — none yet, see [HOOKS.md](HOOKS.md)). Which behaviours can be hooks vs must stay context → [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

Single source of truth: purpose, data, conventions, history.

## Non-negotiables

*(All four are currently context = advisory. The ones a program could check are hooks H1–H6 in GOVERNANCE.md — build those to actually enforce them.)*

- Edit `**template.html`**, never `index.html`; rebuild: `python3 build_site.py`. *(→ H2)*
- Every change: bump version badge + add a `VERSIONS` entry (with SP). *(→ H3–H5)*
- Push to `main`, then send the rebuilt `index.html` to the user.
- `revenue` = turnover/apyvarta · `estimatedIncome` = revenue/spėjamos pajamos. *(context only)*

## What this is

- Self-contained HTML competitor dashboard: **113 LT** communication/marketing/consulting agencies, financials **2019–2024**.
- Built for **Adomas** ([g@cool.lt](mailto:g@cool.lt)) for his company **Fabula**. Source: rekvizitai.vz.lt export `Komunikacija-konsultacija-konkurentai.xlsx`.
- **Fabula = Fabula ir partneriai, UAB** — formerly *Viešųjų ryšių partneriai (VRP)*, code **124099127**, founded 1997-07-03; same entity, rebranded. Its `brand` = `Fabula`.
- Fabula gets special treatment: own section at top, gold highlight in charts, pinned explorer row.

## Files & build

- `template.html` — source of all HTML/CSS/JS; placeholders `__DATA__` + `__SHEETS_DATA__`. **Edit this.**
- `data.json` — 660 records (113 brands × 2019–2024).
- `sheets_data.json` — 7 raw Excel sheets (Data Explorer source).
- `build_site.py` — injects both JSONs into template → `index.html`.
- `index.html` — generated, self-contained (Chart.js CDN). **The deliverable; never hand-edit.**
- `fabula.html` — standalone Fabula profile page (off-dashboard one-off; not linked from the app).
- Workflow: edit template → `python3 build_site.py` → `node --check` the JS → commit + push `main` → send `index.html`.

## Data dictionary (data.json record)

- Fields: `company`, `brand` (the key everywhere), `year`, `activities` (Media, Digital media, Kūryba, PR, PA, BTL, Production house, Konsultantai, Renginiai), `city`, `risk` (LT labels: Žemiausia/Žema/Vidutinė/…), `employees`, `avgSalary` (€/mo), `salaryCosts`, `revenue`, `profit` (net / grynasis pelnas), `nonSalaryCosts`, `estimatedIncome`.
- **Terminology (decided v0.1.2.0):**
  - `revenue` = **turnover / apyvarta** (incl. pass-through media ad spend).
  - `estimatedIncome` = **revenue / spėjamos pajamos** (fee income, pass-through excluded); 625/660 records have it. 2024: €362M turnover vs €100M est. income.
  - UI labels: "Turnover (apyvarta)" = `revenue`; "Revenue (spėjamos pajamos)" = `estimatedIncome`.
  - **Margins computed from `estimatedIncome*`*, labelled "margin from revenue".

## Standing instructions

- **Version badge** in header `<h1>` (e.g. `v0.1.2.1`), every change. Scheme `vA.B.C.D`: bump **C** normal, **D** small patch; **B** only when owner says; **A** reserved.
- **SP** per update, 0.5–10, **effort/time not LOC** (a big template dump = low; a small edit in gnarly code = high). Logged in the `VERSIONS` array in `template.html`, shown via the "📋 SP history" modal.
- **Always send the rebuilt `index.html`** after every change.
- **Every change lands in `main`** — commit direct or merge immediately; never strand work on a side branch.
- **Footer must keep:** "Created by **Adomas** on behalf of **Fabula** · © 2026 Fabula ir partneriai, UAB. All rights reserved."

## Git

- Work from `main`; merge to `main` after finishing.

## ⚠️ Parallel sessions

- Multiple AIs have edited this repo at once and once diverged `main` (one overwrote the other's features).
- Before work: `git fetch origin main` + rebase/merge.
- **Never resolve a `template.html` conflict by taking one side wholesale** — merge feature-by-feature (badge, SP modal, My-company section, turnover/revenue split, Data Explorer) and keep them all.

## Environment

- `rekvizitai.vz.lt` blocked by the sandbox (WebFetch + curl fail); company facts verified via web search.
- Repo private → no free GitHub Pages deploy; used as a local file.
- Branches: `main` (canonical) + historical `claude/`*.

## Open / deferred

- "Key insights" texts still quote **turnover** figures (€362M etc.) — rewrite to spėjamos pajamos only if asked.
- Old `claude/`* branches not deleted.

CLAUDE.md now states it is itself context. |
